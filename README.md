Abstract
--------

This is a C++ library for **MAR**itime **NAV**igation purposes.

It supports (partially):
- NMEA-0183
- AIS
- SeaTalk (Raymarine device communication)
- Basic geodesic functions, suitable for martime navigation.
- Reading data from serial ports (NMEA, SeaTalk). This is a separate library,
  available only if required environment is present, typically a Linux system.

See chapter _Features_ for a complete and detailed list.

---

Goals
-----

There are already implementaions for reading and writing NMEA-0183 or AIS.
The goal of this library is
- to have an implementation in modern C++
- easy to use API (std lib like, integrating well)
- unit tested (high test coverage)
- trivial integration into projects (liberal license, as few dependencies as
  possible)
- (more or less) well documented
- (more or less) complete, as far as information is freely available
- having fun

Examples
--------

More examples [here](examples/README.md).

### Parse NMEA Sentence

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
using namespace marnav;

auto sentence = nmea::make_sentence(
	"$GPRMC,201034,A,4702.4040,N,00818.3281,E,0.0,328.4,260807,0.6,E,A*17");
std::cout << sentence->tag() << "\n";
auto rmc = nmea::sentence_cast<nmea::rmc>(sentence);
std::cout << "latitude : " << nmea::to_string(rmc->get_latitude()) << "\n";
std::cout << "longitude: " << nmea::to_string(rmc->get_longitude()) << "\n";
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a specific sentence directly:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
using namespace marnav;

auto rmc = nmea::create_sentence<nmea::rmc>(
	"$GPRMC,201034,A,4702.4040,N,00818.3281,E,0.0,328.4,260807,0.6,E,A*17");
std::cout << "latitude : " << nmea::to_string(rmc.get_latitude()) << "\n";
std::cout << "longitude: " << nmea::to_string(rmc.get_longitude()) << "\n";
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Write NMEA Sentence

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
nmea::mtw mtw;
mtw.set_temperature(units::celsius{22.5});
std::string data = nmea::to_string(mtw);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Parse AIS Message from NMEA data

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
using namespace marnav;

// received sentences
const std::vector<std::string> received_strings
	= {"!AIVDM,2,1,3,B,55P5TL01VIaAL@7WKO@mBplU@<PDhh000000001S;AJ::4A80?4i@E53,0*3E",
		"!AIVDM,2,2,3,B,1@0000000000000,2*55"};

// parse NMEA sentences
std::vector<std::unique_ptr<nmea::sentence>> sentences;
for (auto const & txt : received_strings) {
	auto sentence = nmea::make_sentence(txt);
	if (sentence->id() == nmea::sentence_id::VDM) {
		sentences.push_back(std::move(sentence));
	}
}

// parse and and process AIS messags
auto payload = nmea::collect_payload(sentences.begin(), sentences.end());
auto message = ais::make_message(payload);
if (message->type() == ais::message_id::static_and_voyage_related_data) {
	auto report = ais::message_cast<ais::message_05>(message);
	std::cout << "shipname: " << report->get_shipname() << "\n";
	std::cout << "callsign: " << report->get_callsign() << "\n";
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Create NMEA sentences from AIS data

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
using namespace marnav;

// prepare AIS data
ais::message_01 pos_report;
pos_report.set_sog(units::knots{8.2});
// ... most data not shown here

// create payload
auto payload = ais::encode_message(pos_report);

// create NMEA sentences
for (uint32_t fragment = 0; fragment < payload.size(); ++fragment) {
	nmea::vdm vdm;
	vdm.set_n_fragments(payload.size());
	vdm.set_fragment(fragment + 1);
	vdm.set_radio_channel(nmea::ais_channel::B);
	vdm.set_payload(payload[fragment]);

	// collect, send or do something with the sentence...
	std::string s = nmea::to_string(vdm);
	std::cout << s << "\n";
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

or simply use `nmea::make_vdms`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
using namespace marnav;

// prepare AIS data
ais::message_01 pos_report;
pos_report.set_sog(units::knots{8.2});
// ... most data not shown here

// create payload
auto payload = ais::encode_message(pos_report);

// create NMEA sentences
auto sentences = nmea::make_vdms(payload);

// process sentences, somehow...
for (auto const & sentence : sentences) {
	std::cout << nmea::to_string(*sentence) << "\n";
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

on Linux hosts.

This chapter describes the requirements in order to build the library.
Tools and their versions are listed below, newer/older/other tools
(i.e. compilers, etc.) may work, but not tested.

Compiler:
- GCC 7
- GCC 8

to build this library.

---

Build
-----

The following build types `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=x` are possible:
- Debug
- Release
- Coverage

Build options:
- `ENABLE_STATIC` : enables static build, if `OFF`, a shared library is being built.
  Default: `ON`
- `ENABLE_PROFILING` : enables profiling for `gprof`
- `ENABLE_BENCHMARK` : enables benchmarking (disables some optimization)
- `ENABLE_SANITIZER` : enables address and undefined sanitizers

Components:
- `ENABLE_EXAMPLES`: enables examples. Default: `ON`
- `ENABLE_TOOLS`: enables tools. Default: `ON`
- `ENABLE_TESTS`: enables unit tests, integration tests and benchmarks. Default: `ON`
- `ENABLE_TESTS_BENCHMARK`: enables benchmark tests, enabled only if `ENABLE_TESTS` is also enabled. Default: `ON`


### Library

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
	make


### Documentation

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make doc


### Package

	make package

or individual package types:

	cpack -G TGZ
	cpack -G DEB


### Developpers Choice

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage ..
	make -j 8
	make coverage doc cppcheck


### Static Analysis with Clang

There is a script ```bin/static-analysis-clang``` for doing this, there is not yet
an integration of clang-tidy in the cmake build.


### Perform Benchmarks

Build in `Release` mode, perform individual benchmarks:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
	make -j 8
	test/benchmark_nmea_split

Using `perf` to do performance analysis:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_BENCHMARK=ON ..
	make -j 8
	perf record -g test/benchmark_nmea_split
	perf report -g 'graph,0.5,caller'


### Formatting Test

There is a helper script ```bin/check-format``` which uses ```clang-format``` to
check the formatting of all files in the directories containing code (```src```,
```test``` and ```examples```). This script can be used manually:

	bin/check-format

or used as git pre-commit hook:

	cd .git/hooks
	ln -s ../../bin/check-format pre-commit

which prevents a commit if there are files not complying with the formatting
rules. Be aware of using the script as pre-commit hook, the checking can take
several seconds.
