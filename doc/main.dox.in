\section abstract Abstract
This is a C++11 library for maritime navigation purposes.
It supports (partially):
- \ref features_nmea
- \ref features_ais
- \ref features_seatalk
- Reading data from serial ports (NMEA, SeaTalk)
- Basic geodesic functions, suitable for martime navigation.
  - Calculation of CPA (closest point of approach)
    and TCPA (time to closest point of approach)
  - Distance of two points on a sphere
  - Distance of two points on an ellipsoid using formula of Vincenty
  - Distance of two points on an ellipsoid using formula of Lambert


\section goals Goals
There are already implementaions for reading and writing NMEA-0183 or AIS.
The goal of this library is
- to have an implementation in modern C++
- easy to use API (std lib like, integrating well)
- unit tested (high test coverage)
- trivial integration into projects (liberal license, as few dependencies as possible)
- (more or less) well documented
- having fun
