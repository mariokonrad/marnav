\section sec_overview_directory Directory Overview
This section explains the directory structure.

- \c bin      : helper scripts
- \c cmake    : CMake Modules
- \c doc      : Documentation
- \c examples : Examples included in the documentation and build as well.
                This examples use the library to demonstrate its usage.
- \c extern   : External projects and resources used by the library.
- \c test     : All tests
- \c include  : Public headers
- \c src      : Complete source of the library, source and private header files.
                Packages are grouped in their own subdirectory, named
                accordingly (e.g. \c marnav/nmea).

In the directories `src` and `include`:
- \c ais     : all AIS related stuff. Note that despite the AIS builds on
               the NMEA protocol (VDM, VDO sentences), the package does not
               have any dependencies to the \c nmea package.
- \c geo     : collection of geographic and geodesic functions
- \c math    : generic math stuff
- \c nmea    : everything NMEA-0183 related
- \c seatalk : everything SeaTalk related, except IO.
- \c utils   : common utils

- \c marnav-ioio : input output stuff, mainly for NMEA and SeaTalk. Please note,
     that this package is not mandatory. It is perfectly fine
     to use the \c nmea package without \c io. The IO is built only if the
     necessary headers are available, typically on a Linux system.

\section sec_overview_package_dependencies Package dependencies
The directory structure underneath \c src reflects the packages.
Every package has its own namespace.

\dot
	digraph G {
		node [shape=record, fonthame=Helvetica, fontsize=10];
		ais -> { geo utils };
		nmea -> { geo utils };
		seatalk -> { utils };
		io -> { nmea seatalk utils };
		geo -> { math };
	}
\enddot

Not shown in the picture:
- The standard library
- Unittests (using GoogleTest/GoogleMock)
- Benchmarking (using Google's Benchmark)
- Examples (some of them use boost.asio or Qt5)


\section sec_overview_general General Stuff

The code of the library is quite defensive. This should usually not
be a problem, because the (usual) environment of a library as this
is not high performance. Some additional checks will not hurt too much.


\section sec_overview_naming Naming Conventions

Everything is in small case (types, classes, structs, member functions,
member data, etc.) with underscores (snakes).

There are occasional exceptions of constants in all captial letters.
For the future, this practice is discouraged.

Reason:
- other libraries do this too (std, boost)
- I like it this way


\section sec_overview_formatting Formatting

Code formatting is done using \c clang-format, using the provided
configuration file (\c .clang-format)


\section sec_overview_header_inclusion Order of Header inclusion

In general the order is from system headers to project headers. The
more private, the later the inclusion.

For header files:
- system headers
- thrid party library headers
- marnav headers

For translation units:
- its own header
- system headers
- thrid party library headers
- marnav headers

With the exception of the translation unit's own header file, are all
header included with full qualified path.
